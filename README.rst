|Build Status| |Documentation Status|

A python package for the analysis of arbitrary cross-sections using the finite element method
written by Robbie van Leeuwen. *sectionproperties* can be used to determine section properties to
be used in structural design and visualise cross-sectional stresses resulting from combinations of
applied forces and bending moments.

Installation:
-------------

For more detailed installation instructions, refer to the
`documentation`_.

UNIX (MacOS/Linux):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   $ pip install sectionproperties

Windows
~~~~~~~

Install *meshpy* by downloading the appropriate `installation wheel`_.

Navigate to the location of the downloaded wheel and install using pip:

Documentation:
--------------

*sectionproperties* has a fully documented python API which you can find at
https://sectionproperties.readthedocs.io/. To read more about the theory behind the program, its
implementation and some more examples, check out my blog at https://robbievanleeuwen.github.io/.

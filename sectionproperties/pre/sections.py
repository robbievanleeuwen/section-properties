                Bézier curve interpolation number. In Rhino a surface's edges are nurb based curves.
                Shapely does not support nurbs, so the individual Bézier curves are interpolated using straight lines.
                This parameter sets the number of straight lines used in the interpolation. 
                Default is 1.
            * *vec1* (``numpy.ndarray, optional``) --
                A 3d vector in the Shapely plane. Rhino is a 3D geometry environment.
                Shapely is a 2D geometric library.
                Thus a 2D plane needs to be defined in Rhino that represents the Shapely coordinate system.
                `vec1` represents the 1st vector of this plane. It will be used as Shapely's x direction.
                Default is [1,0,0].
            * *vec2* (``numpy.ndarray, optional``) --
                Continuing from `vec1`, `vec2` is another vector to define the Shapely plane.
                It must not be [0,0,0] and it's only requirement is that it is any vector in the Shapely plane (but not equal to `vec1`).
                Default is [0,1,0].
            * *plane_distance* (``float, optional``) --
                The distance to the Shapely plane.
                Default is 0.
            * *project* (``boolean, optional``) --
                Controls if the breps are projected onto the plane in the direction of the Shapley plane's normal.
                Default is True.
            * *parallel* (``boolean, optional``) --
                Controls if only the rhino surfaces that have the same normal as the Shapely plane are yielded.
                If true, all non parallel surfaces are filtered out.

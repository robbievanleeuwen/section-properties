# Custom text at start of release
header: >

  This release swaps the new `Triangle` wrapper, [`CyTriangle`](https://github.com/m-clare/cytriangle),
  for [`triangle`](https://github.com/drufat/triangle), thus supporting users with Apple
  Silicon (`macos-arm64`). Many thanks for @m-clare for the hard work with this new
  package!

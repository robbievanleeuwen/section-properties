Theoretical Background
======================

*coming soon...*

In the meantime, here is a `blog post`_ about the theory.

..
   Mention that Poisson's ratios should be relatively close as if the Poisson's
   ratio is largely variable, the basic contention that sig_x = sig_y = sig_xy = 0
   ceases to be applicable.

..
   In this program an effective Poisson's ratio is calculated by determining a
   weighted E and G and then deriving a nu that is effective for the entire
   cross-section.

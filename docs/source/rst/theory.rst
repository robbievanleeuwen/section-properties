Theoretical Background
======================

*coming soon...*

..  Mention that Poisson's ratios should be relatively close as if the Poisson’s
    ratio is largely variable, the basic contention that sig_x = sig_y = sig_xy = 0
    ceases to be applicable.

..  In this program an effective Poisson's ratio is calculated by determining a
    weighted E and G and then deriving a nu that is effective for the entire
    cross-section.
